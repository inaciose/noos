# OSdev - Basic Information

This repository contains sample code and information about bare metal programing on the following ARM devices:
- Banana Pi M1 (Allwinner A20 Cortex A7 - Armv7)
- Raspberry Pi 3

As when i search i didnt found any example of any simple uart input/output for allwiner A20, but there is a lot more about Raspberry Pi most of my effort will be done in banana pi code samples first.

Folder Description
- samples/bpi (bananapi bare metal code samples)
- samples/raspi (rasperrypi bare metal code samples) 

Tutorials code/folders are based on:
- osd: http://wiki.osdev.org/ARM_RaspberryPi_Tutorial_C
- mao: https://github.com/jserv/mini-arm-os

Getting started, journal and more info on https://github.com/inaciose/osdev/wiki

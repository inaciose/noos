sdcrp03

This is ext2 and fat implementation found on jncronin/rpi-boot.

Third cumulative sample of the sdcrpXX series dedicated to reading and writing 
files on sd card using the code found on rpi-boot.

It is not a modified version or wrapper, but the original John Cronin code
extracted and reassembled to a more or less minimal version of its sdcard access library.

New C files:
ext2.c
fat.c
